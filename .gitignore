# .gitignore for the Backtrader ATR Stop-Loss Strategy
#
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git
# should ignore. The goal is to keep the repository clean from
# generated logs, reports, and environment-specific files.
#
# The 'data/' directory is INTENTIONALLY NOT ignored so that
# the repository is self-contained and ready to run.
